# WHAT LURKS WITHIN

An interactive novel experience where every choice matters.

##

*"many a secret lay within the walls."*

*"beliefs twisted around their lies, slowly infesting the expanse like a parasite."*

*"only a choice can defer this cruel fate from befalling the masses."*

*"I hope, for all our sakes, you make that choice, Commander."*

## POSTSCRIPT

Making a game has always been my dream. From the moment I started programming, I knew I wanted to make one eventually.

But, to my dismay, I lack the skills to do anything but write or program. This has been a major obstacle, forcing me to work on smaller projects such as [*koulouri*](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/koulouri) or *ZRpB*.

WHAT LURKS WITHIN is my attempt to shatter that obstacle. All of the skills I've learned from my former projects, including my beloved *koulouri* and every story my precious friends have wrote with me have built up to this moment. Already, it is my biggest project yet (in terms of code), and it will only get bigger.

I may not be able to give you visuals or sound, but I promise to at the very least *try* and deliver an experience worth your time.

Stay tuned, Commander. Arcallis will soon await your arrival.

## PROJECT ALPHA WARNING - PLEASE READ!

WLW is a *VERY* new project (perhaps even *before* the Alpha stage), and everything you see is subject to change!

This repository was made public for recordkeeping purposes, and the game is currently in no way stable. I am not responsible for any save data loss or other issues caused by WLW!
